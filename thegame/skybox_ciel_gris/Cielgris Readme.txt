Skybox that I made for my zombie maps from modifying an already existing base skybox in CS:GO.
It will give a gloomy / horror look to your map. Among other things, I tilted the original texture so that the clouds are vertical, and it gives the impression that the world is "falling appart".

Copy the files to materials/skybox.

Enjoy !
